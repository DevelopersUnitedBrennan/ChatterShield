# Overview
Designed by Aevum DeFi / Developers United

The Aegis DApp is a unique innovation in the DeFi space. By leveraging the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, we've developed a single contract that enables $SHIELD token holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards based on their deposits.

In addition, we've integrated a lottery system where users can use their staking rewards to purchase tickets. Holders of SHIELDS NFTs can also enjoy the benefit of claiming free lottery tickets, enhancing their participation and potential winnings.
